# MPM-FD-FLIM-SNR
This is the repository of a Matlab GUI program that simulates the lifetime measurement process of a multiphoton frequency-domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (MPM-FD-FLIM). The program can also investigate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of the lifetime measurements. More details can be found in the following publication:
